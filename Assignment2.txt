Assignment 2:-

que 1)
 Ans:-
    The 1st loop is 0(n) and the 2nd loop is 0(m).Since we don't know which
is bigger,we say this is 0(n+m). This can also be written as 0(max(n,m)).
   Since there is no additional space being utilized,the space complexity is
constant/0(1).

que2)
Ans:-
    In asymptotic analysis we cdr growth of algorithm in terms of input-size.
An algorithm X is said to be asymptotically better than Y if X takes smaller
time than y for all input sizes n larger than a vlue no where no>0.
